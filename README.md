## PojavAdditionalLanguages
Adding additional languages to PojavLauncher (some of them are already in the launcher but cannot be used, e.g. UpsideDown, LOLCAT, Pirate)

In order to get the languages work you will need to change PojavLauncher language strings file that is the same with your device's language (you **don't** change your device's language with the language you downloaded from here, just the app, don't worry)
### What is PojavLauncher? you might ask
* PojavLauncher is an Android app aimed to bring Minecraft: Java Edition to your Android devices.

* It is made by [artdeell](https://github.com/artdeell), [DuyKhanhTran](https://github.com/khanhduytran0), [LegacyGamerHD](https://github.com/LegacyGamerHD)(retired from project), [crystall1nedev](https://github.com/crystall1nedev)(iOS) and many more contributors!

* You can check the project [here](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher)

## Pros:
* Gaining ability to decompile/build apks (also known as reverse-engineering)
* Learning new funny languages (always wanted to learn enchantment table language)
* No virus guarantee since it is [open source](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher) and you edit the [APK](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apk_(file_format)) by yourself (though if you want to be sure, you can still [virustotal](https://virustotal.com) it.

## Cons:
* It will take some time
* You will be replacing the language you are using pojav with (it is auto chosen from your device language) with the language you want to install.
**NOTE: This action does not change your device language** with any of the languages you install from here!

## Requirements:
* 2 eyes (for reading)
* At least one hand (for clicking the buttons)
* A little empty space on your internal storage (for APKEditor) (you would need at most 500MB)

Passed the requirements ? Nice! (I hope you don't mind the jokes)

# Installation
* Building is moved into [BUILDING.MD](/BUILDING.MD)
